# imdb-clone

This is the final JavaScript project of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://theodinproject.com), at the start I had in mind copying IMDB, but they didn't have a nice API, then I found it's alternative [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and it's fenomenal API.

It fetches data from the API, and get's movies, tv shows, actors profile, search feature.

It was build with ReactJS, using hooks and styled-components for the CSS.

Also implemented backend functionality with Firebase, as Google Authentification, able to rate a movie, add to favorites a movie and add to watchlist a movie.

Able to go to profile and see favorite movies, etc (is a little buggy because of the async story with React, you have to double click the navbar items in the user profile, and I was tired to rewrite everything). Toke aproximately 16 days.
